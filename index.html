	<h2>Welcome to my page!</h2>

	<h2>About me:</h2>
	<p>	My name is Kevin Gonsalves, I am 27 years old and I have performing aircraft maintenance in the United States Air Force for eight years. I have five
	<p>	brothers, of which I am the second youngest. I have four more classes until I am doing with my Computer Programming degree at Southwestern and I'm
	<p>	eager to graduate and pursue commission in the Air Force. </p>
	<p>	I am married and we have two dogs named Winston and Max. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing video games, building computers,
	<p>	and going on cruises.  I am fairly new to computer programming, and have  no experience with HTML. I look forward to building upon this website and learning
	<p>	as much as I can. Below, I attached a picture of my two dogs
	<p>	(Winston on the left, Max on the right).</p>
