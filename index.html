<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>	My name is Kevin Gonsalves, I am 27 years old and I have performing aircraft maintenance in the United States Air Force for eight years. I have five
<p>	brothers, of which I am the second youngest. I have four more classes until I am doing with my Computer Programming degree at Southwestern and I'm 
<p>	eager to gradeuate and pursue commission in the Air Force. I am married and we have two dogs named Winston and Max. In my spare time I enjoy spending 
<p>	time with my family, playing video games, building computers, and going on cruises.  I am fairly new to computer programming, and have  no experience with 
<p>	HTML. I look forward to building upon this website and learning as much as I can. I attached a picture of a Royal Carribean cruise ship and my two dogs
<p>	(Winston on the left, Max on the right).</p>
